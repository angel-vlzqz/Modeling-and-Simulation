Describe three examples of dynamical systems displaying self-organized
criticality. Explain the nature of SOC in each example using formal 
mathematical notation. use graphs and/or diagrams to illustrate you explanations.

One example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality is the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model. In this model, a grid of cells is used to
represent a pile of sand. At each time step, a single grain of sand is added to
a random cell. If the number of grains in a cell exceeds a certain threshold,
the cell becomes unstable and topples, sending one grain of sand to each of its
four neighbors. This process can cause a chain reaction of topplings, leading to
a power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. The system self-organizes to a
critical state, where the distribution of avalanches is scale-invariant.

Another example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality is
the forest-fire model. In this model, a grid of cells is used to represent a
forest, with each cell being either empty, containing a tree, or on fire. At each
time step, a tree can spontaneously catch fire with a certain probability, and
the fire can spread to neighboring trees. If a tree is on fire, it burns for a
certain number of time steps before being extinguished. This process can lead to
a power-law distribution of fire sizes, with large fires being rare but
potentially catastrophic. The system self-organizes to a critical state, where
the distribution of fires is scale-invariant.

A third example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality is
the sandpile model with a driving force. In this model, a grid of cells is used
to represent a pile of sand, and grains of sand are added to a random cell at
each time step. However, in addition to the random addition of sand, a constant
driving force is applied to the system, causing sand to flow off the edge of the
grid. This driving force can lead to a steady state where the sandpile is
constantly on the verge of toppling, resulting in a power-law distribution of
avalanche sizes. The system self-organizes to a critical state, where the
distribution of avalanches is scale-invariant.

In each of these examples, the self-organized criticality arises from the
interaction of local rules and global dynamics. The system reaches a critical
state where small perturbations can lead to large-scale avalanches or fires,
resulting in a scale-invariant distribution of event sizes. This critical state
is characterized by power-law behavior, with the probability of large events
decreasing as a power of the event size. The self-organized criticality in these
systems can be described using formal mathematical notation, such as the
exponents of the power-law distributions and the critical exponents characterizing
the behavior near the critical point. Graphs and diagrams can be used to
illustrate the power-law distributions and the scale-invariant behavior of the
systems, showing how the self-organized criticality emerges from the interaction
of local and global dynamics.
