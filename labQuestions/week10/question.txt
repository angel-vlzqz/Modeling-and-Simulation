How would you visualize the fragmentation of a file system? Propose an 
approach that can be implemented in a computer program with appropriate 
graphing capabilities. Conduct initial proof-of-concept experiments, and 
provide at least two examples of your approach to visualization.

I would visualize the fragmentation of a file system by creating a
graphical representation of the file system. The file system would be
represented as a tree, with the root node representing the file system
itself, and the child nodes representing the files and directories in
the file system. The size of each node would be proportional to the size
of the file or directory it represents.
