How would you use a Taylor polynomial in order to numerically solve a 
nonlinear differential equation? Choose a differential equation and illustrate
your explanation by showing all the steps toward deriving the solution. Use 
formal mathematical notation.

I would use a Taylor polynomial to solve a nonlinear differential equation by
approximating the solution to the differential equation with a Taylor 
polynomial. The Taylor polynomial would be used to approximate the solution to
the differential equation, and the higher order terms of the Taylor polynomial
would be used to improve the accuracy of the approximation.

For example, consider the nonlinear differential equation:

dy/dx = y^2 - x

To solve this differential equation using a Taylor polynomial, we can start by
expanding the solution y(x) as a Taylor series around a point x0:

y(x) = y(x0) + (dy/dx)(x0)(x-x0) + (d^2y/dx^2)(x0)(x-x0)^2/2! + ...

We can then Substitute this Taylor series into the differential equation and 
equate coefficients of like powers of (x-x0) to obtain a system of equations. 
We can solve this system of equations to find the coefficients of the Taylor 
polynomial approximation to the solution y(x).

For example, if we choose x0 = 0 and y(0) = 1 as initial conditions, we can
find the coefficients of the Taylor polynomial approximation to the solution 
y(x) by solving the following system of equations:

1 = 1
dy/dx = 1
d^2y/dx^2 = 2

Substitute these coefficients back into the Taylor polynomial to obtain the
approximation to the solution y(x). This approximation can be used to
numerically solve the nonlinear differential equation and obtain an
approximate solution to the differential equation. The higher order terms of
the Taylor polynomial can be used to improve the accuracy of the approximation.
