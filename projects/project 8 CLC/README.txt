CST-305: Project 8-2 Numerical Integration


Riemann Sum Calculator
This script calculates the Riemann sum of the natural logarithm function (ln(x)) using the midpoint method, over a specified interval from 1 to e (the base of natural logarithms). It provides both the numerical approximation of the integral and a visual representation using a bar plot.

Features
Calculation of Riemann sum for the natural logarithm function over the interval [1, e].
Visual representation of the function and the corresponding Riemann sums using matplotlib.

Prerequisites
Before running this script, you need to have Python installed along with the following Python packages:
numpy
matplotlib

These packages can be installed using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib
