# Queue System Visualization

This Python script visualizes the performance of a basic queueing system under 
different scaling factors. The queueing system is modeled using constants for 
the arrival rate (lambda) and the service rate (mu). The script evaluates the 
system's behavior as the scaling factor \( k \) varies and plots metrics such 
as utilization, throughput, mean number in system, and mean time in system.

## Dependencies

To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with 
the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
